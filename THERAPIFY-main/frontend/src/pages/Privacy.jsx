{ title: "Your rights", body: "You have the right to access, export, correct, or delete your data at any time. You can do this from your account settings or by emailing privacy@therapify.app. We'll respond within 30 days." },
{ title: "Data retention", body: "Active account data is retained until you delete your account. After deletion, all personal data is purged within 30 days. Anonymised aggregate data may be retained for research purposes." },
{ title: "Changes to this policy", body: "If we make material changes, we'll notify you by email and in-app at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use after that date constitutes acceptance." }];
